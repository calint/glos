 [x] c++ conversion
 [x]   replace dynp, dyni, dynf with vector
 [x]   replace str with string
 [ ] namespaces
 [x] hpp files included by main.cpp
 [x] convert structs to classes
 [x] use glm library for math
 [ ] multithreaded grid update
     => initial try with futures and async lambda degrades performance by 50%
 [ ] deleted objects list created during 'update'
 [ ] shader: mtx_wvp * mtx_mw   is it better with mtx_mwvp?
 [x] use unique_ptr instead of new and delete
     => o1store for objects
 [ ] grid: static vs moving objects vs 'bullets'
